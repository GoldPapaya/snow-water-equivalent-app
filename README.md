# Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) Preprocessor & Visualizer
Note: I still need to make a detailed readme for this app. Please be patient as these take some time to write, this is still WIP.

This repository contains two main scripts, bulkProcessor.py and Visualizer.py, which were created for a capstone research project investigating the climatology of Southern Ontario. The former overlays a polygon over a gridded plane with 25km x 25km cells, and outputs the only the cell data contained within the polygon to a .csv.
