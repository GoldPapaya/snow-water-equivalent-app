# Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) Preprocessor & Visualizer
This repository contains two scripts -- bulkProcessor.py and Visualizer.py -- which were created for a capstone research project investigating the climatology of Southern Ontario. The former overlays a polygon over a gridded plane containing 25km x 25km cells, and outputs the only the cell data contained within the polygon to a .csv. The latter simply visualizes NetCDF files, similar to the viewer in ESRI and ESRI adjacent products, where you can pan, zoom, etc..
